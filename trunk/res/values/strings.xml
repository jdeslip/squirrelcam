    <string name="about_squirrels">The squirrels live on a window ledge off the Birge Hall physics building at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nEach spring, the squirrels nest on the window ledge and remain there throughout the summer.\n\nDon\'t see any squirrels on camera?  If all you see is a black image, it is probably night time.  If the time-stamp is changing in the upper left corner, the camera and app are working.  The squirrels usually are out between noon-7pm PST; during this period they come and go from their nest often.  On weekdays, we leave nuts out for the squirrels which increases their presence.</string>
